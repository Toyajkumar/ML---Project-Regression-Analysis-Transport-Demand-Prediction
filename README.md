# Regression Analysis - Transport Demand Prediction

Welcome to the **Regression Analysis - Transport Demand Prediction** project repository. This project focuses on predicting transport demand using regression analysis techniques. The analysis is conducted using Jupyter Notebook and a relevant dataset.

## Files

- `ML_Project_(Regression_Analysis)_Transport_Demand_Prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for predicting transport demand through regression analysis. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and insights.
- `train_revised.csv`: The dataset containing relevant information for transport demand prediction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `ML_Project_(Regression_Analysis)_Transport_Demand_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the analysis and prediction process.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook covers data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format for regression analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore feature selection and engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- **Regression Modeling**: Utilize regression algorithms to predict transport demand based on available features.
- **Evaluation and Insights**: Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics and gain insights into factors influencing transport demand.
