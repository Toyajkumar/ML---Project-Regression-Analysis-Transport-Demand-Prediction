### ML---Project-Regression-Analysis-Transport-Demand-Prediction

In This project we got 1-CSV (Comma_Seperated_Files) named "Nairobi_transport_data.csv" , Where we performed the data cleaning and data manipulation to get an understanding of Dataset.
Later we performed the Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset to explore the over all dataset.
After exploring our dataset we were ready to go for Machine Learning.
Before applying any ML model in our dataset we checked for outliers and removed them from our data, so that our trained model will not give any predictions.
We worked on converting the categorical data into the binary ones.
we applied multiple models on our dataset to see which one is giving the best results , accuracy & low-errors.
At last we found XGBOOST model giving the best results.
The biggest challenge we faced making project was finding the Dependent variable.
